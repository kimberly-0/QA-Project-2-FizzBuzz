## QA Group Project - FizzBuzz

This program loops through a range of numbers up to a user-supplied maximum value and returns 'Fizz' for all numbers that are multiples of three and 'Buzz' for multiples of five. The output is 'FizzBuzz' for numbers which are both multiples of three and five. For numbers that aren't multiples of three and five, it outputs the number as is.
